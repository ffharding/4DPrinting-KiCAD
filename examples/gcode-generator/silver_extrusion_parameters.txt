Sn is the speed at which unprime moves should be executed; this is normally 10,000
 En is the number of pulses on the feed (extrusion) motor to execute; this varies greatly among materials
 Pn is the number of milliseconds relative to the end of the move to begin the unprime (retract) action; a negative number initiates this before the end of the move
 T# is the target head
 In is the flag for executing an Immediate action; so M721 I1 would execute an unprime with the previously specified values at that point in the gcode.

Pn is the number of pulses on the motor to dispense 1 Î¼l (for volumetric) or 1 mm (for linear) of material;
 Sn is the direct flow multiplier (to allow for undersized or oversized stock;
 Wn is the width of the cross section of the volume to fill;
 Zn is the height (layer thickness) of the cross section of the volume to fill; and
 T# is the tool (head) to which these values will be applied.
